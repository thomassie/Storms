```{r setup, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```



## Loading data

I downloaded the data sets from NOAA's [National Hurricane Center](http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/data/#hurdat), one for hurricanes and one for typhoons, and stored them in my respective GitHub repository. It is the revised Atlantic hurricane database (HURDAT2, see [here](http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/hurdat/Data_Storm.html) for details). 

```{r, echo = TRUE}

```





This is what the original Atlantic data looks like:
```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
str(dd.atlantic.org)
```

...and the data from the Pacific:
```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
str(dd.pacific.org)
```
